### Introduction

More electric cars are on the road everyday. This makes you wonder, can I afford one? To answer this question, I analyzed the market of Teslas to discover which had the best value. I sampled three different models with varying options. In 2012, Tesla offered a four door sedan called the Model S. Next, a SUV named the Model X that seats 7 became available in 2016. Most recently, in 2018, the compact Model 3 was released to the public.

### Web Scraping

There were no easily accessible datasets for my topic, so I had to get creative. To create custom data, I used a Python’s [Beautiful Soup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ng2o98k983k&t=2467s) web scraping tutorial. Parsing the data from [cars.com](https://www.cars.com/for-sale/searchresults.action/?mdId=21655&mkId=28263&page=1&perPage=100&searchSource=PAGINATION&sort=relevance&stkTypId=28881&zc=99019) was easy because of their user-friendly API. The values came out relatively clean because the script removed symbols and converted strings to integers. Finally, I one-hot encoded the categorical features to numerical so I can fit a model.

### Baseline
The model was a supervised learning regression because the target (price) was numerical. To get started, I established a baseline by taking the mean of the data. The calculated baseline is significant because it establishes an educated guess of what a random Model S on the road would cost.

### Machine Learning

With a few key features, I was confident that machine learning techniques could accurately predict the price of a given Tesla. Each method reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) to better predict the target (price). 

1. Linear Regression was deployed to do a 80/20 split into training/validation. The split holds out the data from the testing subset to prevent leakage. Leakage means it is overfit and fit too good to be true. It is used to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.

2. Ridge Regression found a new line that didn’t fit the training data as well. In other words, it introduced a small amount of bias into how the new line fit to the data. But in return for that small amount of bias, we get a significant drop in variance. By starting with a slightly worse fit, it can provide better long-term predictions.

3. XG Boost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) was used because it is engineered for computational time minimization and memory allocation efficiency. XG Boost accomplishes this performance enhancement using a block structure to support the parallelization of tree construction.

4. Random Forest scored the lowest MAE because each decision tree is trained on a random bootstrap sample of the data. This type of ensembling is called “bagging.” Each split is considered a random subset of the features.

### Permutation Importance

I was curious which features influenced the price the most. As suspected, the mileage was the most important factor followed by the year.

### Conclusion

If I had a budget of $40,000 then I would need to decide between an older Model S or newer Model 3. My choice was the Model 3 because it has ludacris mode and autopilot capabilities. That way I could take a quick nap during my commute.
