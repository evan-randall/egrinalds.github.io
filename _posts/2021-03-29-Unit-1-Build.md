subtitle: Find out the most affordable city

### Introduction

My experience in data science so far has been challenging but rewarding. This post is to demonstrate what I learned in only four weeks. I have applied my new skills to help make financial decisions easier during the job search. First, you will discover the starting pay in ten different areas across the country. Next, the cost of living be analyzed. Then, you will determine which city will allow you to save up for a house down payment in the least amount of time. Last, you will see a monthly budget of what is required to save. 

### Where can I earn the most money?

The data indicated that San Francisco is the best choice to brag to your friends about your new [$109,420](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/san-francisco-junior-data-scientist-salary-SRCH_IL.0,13_IM759_KO14,35.htm) salary as a Junior Data Scientist. However, in California this gross income is taxed at [29.98%](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes#hj1AMoS3uX/) leaving you with a net income of $76,616. Comparatively, Seattleâ€™s gross income is $96,739 and taxed at 22.6%. This results in a $74,876 net income and is only $1,740 less even though you were earning $12,681 more in San Francisco. The difference is because there is no state income tax in Washington.

### Are wages adjusted enough for San Francisco?

The answer is no, wages are not adjusted nearly enough. In a third of the time, you can save for a house in Austin (5.49 years) vs. San Francisco (16.49 years). I calculated this by taking local 20% downpayment amount and divided it by saving 20% annual net income. These numbers may be alarming, but keep in mind there are other variables to consider that could equalize the time saving period. Your earning capacity will increase as you gain career experience. You could also get married and have two incomes to contribute.

### Conclusions

The data is clear: Austin is the frugal choice. The average 2 bed-2 bath rental apartment is [$1,520](https://www.nerdwallet.com/cost-of-living-calculator/compare/austin-tx-vs-san-francisco-ca). This can be split with a roommate for $760. Based on the gross annual income of $81,160, the 17% Incoming Sharing Agreement "ISA" payment totals $1,150 per month. Saving 20% of annual net income will take you 5.49 years to save a 20% down payment because the average home is $347,906.
